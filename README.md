# Face-Expression-Recognition-System

Face Emotion Recognition Project is developed using Opencv + Python bindings. The project uses "face_recognition" dlib library trained on deep learning. Frames are streamed directly from the raspberry pi(client) to the server using "imagezmq" python library which is based on 'zmq' protocol. An encoding file(encoding.pickle) which contains the encodings of the faces of persons is stored before hand. Frame processing that is encoding each incoming frame and comparing that encoding with the already stored encoding of the faces takes place on the server side. The frame containing the faces is analyzed by the model (classifier in our case) and their emotion is predicted accordingly. Livefeed is shown at last. Once the faces are recognized and the model predicts their emotion, a message (people_detected pickle file)is sent to the raspberry pi.

Based on this message, LED attached to the raspberry pi changes its color which shows the confirmation to the user that the face is recognized. The frames and message are exchanged between the raspberry pi and the server using the local network IP. Mutiple raspberry pi's can send their live feed at the same time to the server for face emotion recognition process.
